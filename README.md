## object tracker based on sort alorithm and darknet_ros

Use [darkent_ros](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros) as object detector. Specially, I use yolov3-tiny as the object detection algorithm. Then, I use [sort algorithm](https://github.com/abewley/sort) as traking method. All code runs under ROS kinetic, Ubuntu 16.04.
